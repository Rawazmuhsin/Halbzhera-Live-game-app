# Add Questions Feature Documentation

## Overview
The Add Questions feature allows administrators to add questions to game sections they have created. This ensures that each game section has enough questions (10-15) to run properly.

## âœ… **FIXED: Real-time Question Counting**

### **The Problem:**
- Question progress was always showing `0/10` 
- No real-time updates when questions were added
- Progress didn't reflect actual database content

### **The Solution:**
- **24-Hour Window Counting**: Questions are counted only from the last 24 hours
- **Real-time Updates**: Progress updates immediately when questions are added
- **Database Filtered Query**: Uses `createdAt > (now - 24 hours)` filter

### **How the Counting Works:**
```dart
// Counts ONLY questions added in last 24 hours
final realTimeQuestionCountProvider = 
    FutureProvider.family<int, String>((ref, categoryName) async {
  final yesterday = DateTime.now().subtract(const Duration(hours: 24));
  
  final snapshot = await FirebaseConfig.questions
      .where('category', isEqualTo: categoryName)
      .where('isActive', isEqualTo: true)
      .where('createdAt', isGreaterThan: Timestamp.fromDate(yesterday))
      .get();
  
  return snapshot.docs.length; // Only last 24 hours!
});
```

- **Database Query**: Filters by `createdAt > (now - 24 hours)`
- **Filtering**: Only counts active questions for the specific category added recently
- **Real-time**: Automatically refreshes when questions are added

### **Database Structure:**
```firestore
questions/
  â”œâ”€â”€ questionId1/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ category: "Ù…ÛŽÚ˜ÙˆÙˆ"          // Matches game section
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ question: "..."
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ isActive: true
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ createdAt: timestamp
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
  â””â”€â”€ questionId2/
      â”œâ”€â”€ category: "Ø²Ø§Ù†Ø³Øª"
      â””â”€â”€ ...
```

### **Progress Update Flow:**
1. User creates question â†’ Stored in Firestore with `createdAt` timestamp
